//     1. Depth of Knowledge

//     This insight assesses a candidate's ability to move beyond theoretical knowledge. A high score shows they can discuss specific implementation details, trade-offs, and how to design solutions around a technology's limitations, demonstrating practical, real-world experience rather than just a textbook understanding. 

//     2. Impact-Oriented Mindset

//     This insight evaluates a candidate's focus on the business value of their work. A strong candidate quantifies their achievements using specific metrics (like Lighthouse scores) and clearly explains how their technical decisions translated into tangible benefits for the user experience, company, or team.

//     3. Architectural Flexibility

//     This insight measures a candidate's adaptability to complex, modern system designs. It tests their understanding of advanced patterns like micro-frontends and microservices, and their ability to apply core software engineering principles to new and challenging distributed environments.

//     4. Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills

//     This insight assesses a candidate's methodical approach to resolving technical issues. A high score indicates a systematic, logical process for debugging, including the ability to use specific tools, form hypotheses, and test them, rather than relying on a vague, unstructured approach.

//     5. Collaboration and Communication

//     This insight evaluates a candidate's effectiveness in a team. It focuses on their understanding of collaborative practices like writing clean, testable code, documenting APIs, and making technical decisions that benefit the long-term maintainability and success of a project for all team members.

        You are a STRICT evaluator who must score a candidate's answers and generate a report on the following 5 parameters:

        1. **Depth of Knowledge**  
        Measures ability to go beyond theory, discussing implementation details, trade-offs, and designing solutions within technology limitations. High scores reflect real-world experience.

        2. **Impact-Oriented Mindset**  
        Evaluates focus on business value. Strong candidates quantify achievements with metrics (e.g., Lighthouse scores) and link technical decisions to tangible benefits.

        3. **Architectural Flexibility**  
        Assesses adaptability to modern, complex systems, understanding of patterns (micro-frontends, microservices), and applying core software engineering principles in distributed environments.

        4. **Problem-Solving and Debugging Skills**  
        Looks at systematic, logical debugging with clear hypotheses, testing, and specific tool usage, avoiding vague/unstructured approaches.

        5. **Collaboration and Communication**  
        Judges team effectiveness, clean/testable code, API documentation, and long-term maintainability-focused decisions.

        **Marking Rules:**  
        - Do not be lenient.  
        - If the candidate’s answer is a direct copy-paste of the expected answer, score it **0**.  
        - Be realistic in scoring.
